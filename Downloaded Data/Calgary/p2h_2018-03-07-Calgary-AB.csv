Location, location location is the mantra when buying real estate, especially investment properties.  This prime offering has a stellar location, can either be moved right into, or used as an excellent income/investment property.  Currently, this cozy and clean property is used as an Airbnb, and brings in a monthly average income of over $2,000.00.  This leaves the fortunate purchase with several fantastic options available to you:  1)  Buy the home unfurnished as offered, and move right, 2) Buy the home unfurnished as offered, and rent it out as a long term rental for investment income, 3) Make an offer on the home as a ""turn key"" package and purchase the existing Airbnb business and furnishings (a few minor items of furniture are personal and will be excluded or replaced).  As the Calgary market appears to be in the initial stages of a real estate recovery, this property will only grow as an asset. If you check out the neighbourhood, you will find new infills are being built on similar size lots and being sold for upwards of $1,000,000.

Many may consider this offering, but only one will be rewarded with the opportunity.  Book your appointment today.

Although the family home is a tear-down valued for land only; it backs onto a Spruce Forest (the likes of which is seldom seen in Calgary) that extends to the rear of the property.

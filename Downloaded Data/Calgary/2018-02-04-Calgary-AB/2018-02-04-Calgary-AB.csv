"24","207 EVANSFORD CI NW, Calgary, Alb","T3B4N3","OPEN HOUSE SUNDAY FEBRUARY 4 1-3PM!!1707 SQ. FT. OF TOTAL LIVING AREA! Hello, I am a rarely found 4 level split. I was built by Broadview Home in 2007. I am located on a very quiet street surrounded by other wonderful homes filled with extraordinary families. I think one of my best features is the vaulted ceilings that greets you as you walk in my front door. I have brand new appliances. I am proud of my open concept and how functional my floorplan is. Upstairs I host three bedrooms that I cannot wait to be filled with a new family. On my third level I have enjoyed watching my family use it as a very large rec room; watching movies, playing games and just straight up relaxing.  I think that is one of my favorite memories with them. Although I am not fully completed on my fourth floor, I know my current family has used it to store their photos and extra belongings. I have a fully fenced backyard because I think it's important in case my new family has a pet. I would love for you to be my new family.
